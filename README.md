**Electricity Sales Forecasting With External Variables**

Traditional and machine learning methods, when applied, provide accurate predictions of future consumption. However, the presence of certain exogenous factors such as weather conditions and electricity prices complicate the prediction task and produce poor predictions. Models such as SARIMAX, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest have been known to capture relationships between variables and generalize well with data that contains exogenous variables. Making use of these models, electricity sales were forecasted using temperature, electricity price and unemployment rate as exogenous variables. The results show that SARIMAX has a prediction performance when temperature, price and unemployment rate are applied separately, with temperatures producing the best performance. When all variables are applied to the sales data, random forests had the best prediction performance.
